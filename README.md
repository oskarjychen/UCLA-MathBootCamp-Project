This repository consists of three different reports I created from the prompts given by homework assignments given by Professor Charles Rambo 
in a preparatory class at UCLA in 2025.

I used a variety of techniques to answer the questions. Some were solved by code, while others were approached analytically and presented 
using LaTex.

The original questions were not uploaded out of respect to Professor Rambo's course.
